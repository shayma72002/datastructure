# 📚 Data Structure Book in Dart - 5 Hours

This repository contains solutions to six data structure challenges using the Dart programming language. These exercises are derived from the **Kodeco** book and are meant to assess understanding of key data structure concepts including **Stacks** and **Linked Lists**.

## 🚀 Objective

To demonstrate the ability to:
- Learn independently
- Implement core data structure concepts in Dart
- Solve real-world problems using custom data structures

## 📘 Covered Topics

### ✅ Basic Data Structures in Dart

- Introduction to fundamental data structures
- Custom class creation and method implementation

### ✅ Stacks

A stack is a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure with `push`, `pop`, and `peek` operations.

### ✅ Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next. Includes operations like insertion, deletion, reversal, and traversal.

## 🧪 Challenges

### 🗂️ Stack Challenges

#### 🔁 Challenge 1: Reverse a List
**Description**: Create a function that prints the contents of a list in reverse order using a stack.

#### ⚖️ Challenge 2: Balance the Parentheses
**Description**: Given a string, check if the parentheses (`(` and `)`) are balanced.

### 🔗 Linked List Challenges

#### 🔁 Challenge 1: Print in Reverse
**Description**: Print the elements of a linked list in reverse order (without modifying the list).

#### 🎯 Challenge 2: Find the Middle Node
**Description**: Find and return the middle node in a singly linked list.

#### 🔃 Challenge 3: Reverse a Linked List
**Description**: Reverse a linked list by re-linking its nodes in the opposite direction.

#### ❌ Challenge 4: Remove All Occurrences
**Description**: Remove all occurrences of a specific value from a linked list.
